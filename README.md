# AI Label Mockup Generator

An AI-powered label visualization tool that helps businesses showcase their custom label designs on realistic product scenes. Upload your label artwork and instantly see it on professional product photographs generated by Google Gemini AI.

## What This Does

This application allows users to:
- Upload custom label artwork (PNG/JPEG)
- Select label size (3x2" or 4x6")
- Generate realistic product mockups using AI
- Preview and download professional-looking product photographs

The AI generates photorealistic product scenes (currently candles) around your uploaded label design, preserving your artwork exactly as-is while creating natural lighting, shadows, and environments.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Generation**: Uses Google Gemini's image generation API to create unique product photographs
- **Label Preservation**: Your uploaded artwork is never modified - text, colors, and layout remain exactly as designed
- **Drag-and-Drop Upload**: Simple file upload interface with validation
- **Instant Preview**: View generated mockups in-browser
- **Download Ready**: Export high-quality images for marketing materials

## How It Works

1. **Upload**: Drag and drop your label artwork (supports PNG and JPEG, max 10MB)
2. **Select Size**: Choose your label dimensions (3x2" or 4x6")
3. **Generate**: Click "Generate Mockup" and wait ~10-20 seconds
4. **Download**: Preview and download your professional product photograph

The AI receives your label artwork along with strict prompt instructions to generate a realistic product scene while treating your artwork as sacred - it only creates the container, lighting, shadows, and environment around your label.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- Google Gemini API key ([Get one here](https://ai.google.dev/))

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd labelvisualizer
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create environment file:
```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

4. Add your Gemini API key to `.env.local`:
```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=10
DAILY_GENERATION_LIMIT=5
```

### Running the Application

**Development Mode:**
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application.

**Production Build:**
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 16.1.1 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4
- **AI Service**: Google Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash-image` model)
- **Image Processing**: Sharp library
- **Storage**: Local filesystem (MVP)

## Project Structure

```
/app
  /api/generate          # Mockup generation endpoint
  /components
    FileUpload.tsx       # Drag-and-drop upload component
    LabelSizeSelector.tsx # Label size selection UI
  page.tsx               # Main landing page

/lib
  gemini.ts              # Gemini AI integration
  imageProcessing.ts     # Image hashing and utilities

/public
  /uploads               # User-uploaded artwork
  /generated             # AI-generated mockups

/types
  index.ts               # TypeScript definitions
```

## API Usage

### Generate Mockup Endpoint

**POST** `/api/generate`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "artworkFile": {
    "name": "label.png",
    "type": "image/png",
    "size": 524288,
    "data": "base64_encoded_image_data"
  },
  "labelSize": "3x2",
  "productType": "candle"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "mockup": {
    "imageUrl": "/generated/abc123-candle-3x2-1234567890.png",
    "artworkHash": "abc123...",
    "generatedAt": "2026-01-12T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Cost & Performance

- **Generation Time**: 10-20 seconds per mockup
- **Cost per Generation**: ~$0.039 (based on Gemini API pricing)
- **File Size Limit**: 10MB max upload
- **Supported Formats**: PNG, JPEG

## Development Notes

### Important Architectural Decisions

1. **No Pre-Built Scenes**: Unlike traditional mockup tools, this uses AI to generate unique product photographs on demand - no scene libraries or manual compositing required.

2. **Prompt Engineering**: The Gemini API receives strict instructions to preserve the uploaded label artwork exactly as-is while generating realistic product environments.

3. **Caching Strategy**: Future implementation will cache generated results using `${artworkHash}-${sceneId}-${labelSize}` as cache key to reduce API costs.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Google Gemini API key (required) | - |
| `MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB` | Maximum upload size in MB | 10 |
| `DAILY_GENERATION_LIMIT` | Rate limit per user | 5 |

## Future Enhancements

- Multiple product types (bottles, jars, boxes)
- Result caching to reduce API costs
- User authentication and rate limiting
- Email capture for lead generation
- Watermarked downloads for free users
- Premium features for authenticated users

## Business Context

This MVP serves as a proof-of-concept for a lead generation tool that converts organic traffic into qualified leads at $3-5 per lead (vs. $60-80 Google Ads cost). The production implementation will be built with ASP.NET Core + Vue 2.7, using Azure Blob Storage and Redis caching.
